# About Me: *Andrew Buchholz*
---

#### Brief Bio  
 > I was born and raised in Augusta Ga, attended a fine arts middle and high school, and then graduated with a degree in political science from Augusta University.
 > I have one sibling, a sister, who is a microbiologist at the CDC.


 ### Hobbies
+ Running  
+ Golf  
+ Reading  
+ Learning new skills  
+ Board Games   


### `Software Development`
 > Since I am still learning so many new things about development, I am keeping an open mind about what career path I want to pursue. Web development for a marketing agency seems like an exciting environment to be in as a first job, but with continued learning I would like to open myself up to other opportunities outside of purely web dev. Some topics that interest me are:
 > 1. Progressive Web Apps  
 > 2. Automation
 > 3. E-commerce 
 > 4. Data Visualization
